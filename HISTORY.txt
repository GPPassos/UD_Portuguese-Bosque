This is an improved version of Bosque 7.5 UD, originally available
from Linguateca at the following URLs:

Issues found in the original Bosque 7.5 UD have been opened as issues
in this project, with the prefix [bosque-ud]; they have been either
fixed at the source (PALAVRAS and/or UD conversion), workarounds have
been provided by the script "fix-errors.sh". 

Manually editing the file is discouraged and should only be made as a
last resort.
