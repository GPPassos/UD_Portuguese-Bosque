### Definition

A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically
signal events and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a
clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which
may occur in the clause. Verbs are often associated with grammatical
categories like tense, mood, aspect and voice, which can either be
expressed inflectionally or using auxilliary verbs or particles.

Note that the `VERB` tag covers main verbs _(content verbs)_ and
_copulas_ but it does not cover _auxiliary verbs_, for which there is
the [AUX]() tag. Auxiliares are verbs that are used in verb phrases expressing 
only grammatical function (as tense or mood) and do not have semantic content. 
For example, _ia fazer_ ("go to do") and _começou a fazer_ ("begin to do"), 
where "ir/go"  and "começar/begin" are auxiliaries.


Note that we can have more than one auxiliary in a verbal phrase: _parece estar a influenciar_, where "parece" and "estar" should be tagged as auxiliaries.


Note that _participles_ are word forms that may share properties and
usage of adjectives and verbs. Depending on language and context, they
may be classified as either `VERB` or [ADJ]().

_Gerunds_ and _infinitives_ are classified as `VERB`.

<!-- Note that there are verb forms such as _transgressives_ or _adverbial
participles_ that share properties and usage of adverbs and
verbs. Depending on language and context, they may be classified as
either `VERB` or [ADV](). -->

### Examples

- _correr, comer_
